  "additional_comments": "For the Parea Express location (540 Montréal Rd, Ottawa, ON K1K 4R4), the website should make it very clear that this is a take-out only counter. There is no dine-in or table reservation option. Customers should be guided directly toward the online ordering system for this location so the flow is fast and convenient.\n\nUnlike the Orléans restaurant, Express is all about quick, fresh, and delicious meals to-go, prepared with the same high-quality ingredients as Parea Orléans. The website should highlight that Express is ideal for busy customers who want authentic Greek food without the wait.\n\nWe don’t need a reservations section for this location, but the menu and ordering process should be simple and user-friendly to avoid any confusion with Orléans.",
